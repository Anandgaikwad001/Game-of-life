# Game-of-life
The Game of Life was first published in the Martin Gardner’s column in October 1970 issue of Scientific American, resulting in the greatest number of letters from readers at that time
While John Conway was an undergraduate at Cambridge University, he would write letters to Martin Gardner on various mathematical games. Sometimes, Martin would use the letters in his Scientific American column on mathematical puzzles.
While at Cambridge, John Conway used to play various games using Go board with his friends during teatime. Being bored with real games, like “five in a line”, John tried to invent new games.

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by loneliness.
2. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overcrowding.
3. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives, unchanged, to the next generation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors comes to life.
